# MultiArcade
 
## Introduction

A simple arcade console based on an ESP32, a TFT and a paddle-control with 2 fire buttons

## Hardware

You need an ESP32, a screen and a rotary encoder. The rotary encoder should be debounced but it may work without it.
I've done a simple wiring scheme with fritzing ..... please don't mind my not-existing fritzing skills ... :)

## Software

Source code can be found here. You'll need Bodmers [TFT_eSPI lib](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) for display output.

I try not to overcomplicate the code .... so many things are not done the way they should have been done.
